    <string name="vienna_text">Apart from being regarded as the City of Music because of its musical
        legacy, Vienna is also said to be The City of Dreams because it was home to the worlds
        first psycho analyst Sigmund Freud. The city s roots lie in early Celtic and Roman
        settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city, and then the capital of the
        Austro Hungarian Empire. It is well known for having played an essential role as a leading
        European music centre, from the great age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of
        the 20th century. The historic centre of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles,
        including Baroque castles and gardens, and the late 19th century Ringstra√üe lined with grand
        buildings, monuments and parks.
